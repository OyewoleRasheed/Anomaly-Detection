Anomaly-Detection
This repository contains the code for anomaly detection in irradiation and weather datasets for 12 German cities. The project aims to enhance data quality and integrity by identifying and compensating for anomalies in meteorological data using both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
Project Overview
The project employs the following algorithms for anomaly detection:
Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
XGBoost
Autoencoder
Naive Bayes
Among these, the Autoencoder model demonstrated the highest performance, detecting the most significant percentage of anomalies. 
Post-detection, anomalies were compensated for to improve the datasets, ensuring data quality for more accurate predictions in solar and wind power generation.
