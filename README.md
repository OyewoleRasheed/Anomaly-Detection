# Anomaly-Detection
This repository contains the code for anomaly detection in irradiation and weather dataset for 12 German Cities.
This project involve using supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to detect anomaly in meteorological data
and compensate for them to ensure data quality and integrity. The project uses LOF, Xgboost, Autoencoder and Naive Bayes algorithm.
Autoencoder was the best performing model, detecting the highest percentage of anomaly.
